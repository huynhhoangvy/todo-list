# CoderSchool FTW - * Todo List *

Created with effort by: Huynh Hoang Vy
  
Just a simple todo list. 

## Milestones Completed

- [x] Add Event and Keep Track of Todos
- [x] Update Todo List on Page
- [x] Add a remove button
- [x] Add a "done" field

## Optional User Stories

- [x] Toggle between done and not done
- [x] Change the Link Text
- [x] Strikethrough
- [x] Add a checkbox filter to show only done or undone.
- [x] Persist locally 


The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] User can click on the title and set a new name.
* [x] Press ENTER instead of "add" to input the data.
* [x] Change icons for done, undone and remove.


## Time Spent and Lessons Learned

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total.

Once again, working with both HTML and JS is hard, I could barely catch up with the instructions on class at first.
